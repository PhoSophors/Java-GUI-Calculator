# 1. INTRODACTION


    The first scientific calculator that included all of the basic features above was the programmable Hewlett-Packard HP-9100A,[1] released in 1968, though the Wang LOCI-2 and the Mathatronics Mathatron had some features later identified with scientific calculator designs. The HP-9100 series was built entirely from discrete transistor logic with no integrated circuits, and was one of the first uses of the CORDIC algorithm for trigonometric computation in a personal computing device, as well as the first calculator based on reverse Polish notation entry. HP became closely identified with RPN calculators from then on, and even today some of their high-end calculators (particularly the long-lived HP-12Cfinancial calculator and the HP-48 series of graphing calculators) still offer RPN as their default input mode due to having garnered a very large following.

# 3. SYSTEM DESIGN

    Then we began with the design phase of the system. System design is a solution, a “HOW TO” approach to the creation of a new system. It translates system requirements into ways by which they can be made operational. It is a translational from a user-oriented document to a document-oriented programmer. For that, it provides the understanding and procedural details necessary for the implementation. Here we use Flowchart to supplement the working of the new system. The system thus made should be reliable, durable and above all should have least possible maintenance costs. It should overcome all the drawbacks of the Old existing system and most important of all meet the user requirements.
    
# 4. APPLICATION
    
    In most countries, students use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic arithmetic skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations "in the head", with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching estimation techniques and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in. Others have argued that calculator use can even cause core mathematical skills to atrophy, or that such use can prevent understanding of advanced algebraic concepts.

    There are other concerns - for example, that a pupil could use the calculator in the wrong fashion but believe the answer because that was the result given. Teachers try to combat this by encouraging the student to make an estimate of the result manually and ensuring it roughly agrees with the calculated result. Also, it is possible for a child to type in −1 × −1 and obtain the correct answer '1' without realizing the principle involved. In this sense, the calculator becomes a crutch rather than a learning tool, and it can slow down students in exam conditions as they check even the most trivial result on a calculator.
    
# 5. TESTING

    Testing is the major control measure used during software development. Its basic function is to detect errors in the software. During requirement analysis and design, the output is a document that is usually textual and no executable. After the coding phase, computer programs are available that can be executed for testing purpose. This implies that testing not only, has to uncover errors introduced during coding, but also errors introduced during previous phase. Thus, the goal of testing is to uncover the requirements, design and coding errors in the programs. The Source code declared above for the program of Scientific Calculator has been tested and it has been found that the above source code is okay and correct. The program involves many types of conversions. These conversions have to done carefully.
    
# 6. CONCLUSION

    The effectiveness of the scientific calculator in solving non-linear equations by the Newton Raphson method has been verified in this study. The usage of the scientific calculator in solving non-linear equations by the Newton-Raphson method improves students’ marks. Students’ marks increased after the respondents were exposed to the method of solving the non-linear equations by the Newton-Raphson method by using scientific calculator. Time reduced tremendously when the participants answered questions utilizing the Casio fx-570ES scientific calculator. This research also shows that the common mistakes made by the participants are reduced after they were taught the technique to solve the problem using the calculator

    [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator#CITEREFSmith1929 is an example of such rounding errors -- the algorithm's arcsin(arccos(arctan(tan(cos(sin(9)))))) should come out 9 on standard floating point hardware, but for CORDIC it's a pathological case that produces different rounding errors on each chip that it is implemented on. The algorithm is primarily used to identify the manufacturer of a particular calculator's CPU, since it is usually reproducible between chips of the same model.

    [4] According to Schmandt-Besserat 1981, these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers, marks were placed on the outside of the containers, for the count. Eventually (Schmandt-Besserat estimates it took 4000 years) the marks on the outside of the containers were all that were needed to convey the count, and the clay containers evolved into clay tablets with marks for the count.
